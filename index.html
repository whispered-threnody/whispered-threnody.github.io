    <p>Well, here we are! This place exists now.</p>
    <p>The primary reason you might be here is because of a pdf of <a href="http://www.whispered-forge.work/rsc/advisories.pdf">"Advisories"</a> that I released some time ago, but you might have also been drawn in as a result of one of the informational surveys I've put out. </p>
