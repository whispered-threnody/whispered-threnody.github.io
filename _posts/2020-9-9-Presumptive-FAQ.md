Here's some basic stuff regarding "The Guide" or what's currently called "Advisories from the Meshold", and on myself as an author.



- Did you write that dumb guide?

Yes. I wrote it.

- Your name is really generic.

Yes. That's on purpose. 

- You didn't cover my situation.

Neat. It's meant to be a very general advice guide. Email me if it's that important and I'll consider a revision.

- Are you trying to tell me how to live my life?

Yes. Rather, I'm trying to enable you, theoretical reader, how to skip a bunch of miserable, bone-rending lessons and take advantage of the experience of others.
