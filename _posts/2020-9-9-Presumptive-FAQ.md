Here's some basic stuff regarding "The Guide" or what's currently called the Advisories, and a couple questions I get asked.

- Did you write that dumb guide?

Yes. I wrote it.

- Your name is really generic.

Yes. That's on purpose. 

- You didn't cover my situation.

Neat. It's meant to be a very general advice guide. Email me if it's that important and I'll consider a revision.

- Are you trying to tell me how to live my life?

Yes. But not like, by force. Rather, I'm trying to enable anyone and tip them off as to how to skip a bunch of miserable, bone-rending lessons and take advantage of the experience of others. All researchers stand on the shoulders of giants who stood on the shoulders of giants.
