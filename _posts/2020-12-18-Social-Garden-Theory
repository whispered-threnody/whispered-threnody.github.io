title: Social Garden Theory

From time to time, I get asked relationship advice. I don't know why anyone would ask *me* relationship advice, but here's what I tell them, anyway:

People tend to want companionship and love, not realizing that those are end products rather than the beginning.

Let me explain. The juicy fruit of companionship is your end goal. You want fruit.
If you want fruit, you need plants. Plants need seeds, seeds need nutrition and water.
In this metaphor, your life is a garden, and you are its gardener. People who seek to skip straight to companionship and love are the same as those who want to skip to having a blooming garden in days: It's good that they want growth and fruit, but they will almost certainly need to work for it.
Certainly, you can luck out. Your soil might already be wet and rich, free of rocks. Maybe you started with roses and berries already in your garden. By the same token, you might start with barren, dry soil. Thick with weeds and nothing else.
It's important to grasp this. Not everyone has an equally easy time maintaining the garden that is their life. 
The point of this metaphor - the thrust of it - is that you are unlikely to get the fruit you crave without the middle steps; It is something best produced from a strong foundation. 
If you seek to obtain companionship, and loved ones, and relationships, you should cultivate all of the good plants in your garden. Do not throw away those that don't fruit and only flower, but don't hesitate to destroy those plants that only exist to choke others out.
If you only seek fruit and discard all else, you'll lack friends and you'll miss out on the wonderful relations one can have that are entirely platonic. If you let the thorns in your life strangle all else, you'll get nothing.

It's an overly flowery metaphor, for a forgeworker, but it gets the point across, no?
