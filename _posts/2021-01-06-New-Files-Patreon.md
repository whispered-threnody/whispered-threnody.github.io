title: New Files, Works, and Patreon
---
With support from my friends and colleagues, I have elected to continue this writing thing that we've got going here. I have two more booklets planned, with intent for them to be significantly broader in scope than my simple tips and tricks Guide. 

Another thing that I've been encouraged to do and finally caved on was the creation of a Patreon. All Advisory works will always be free - knowledge and studies like this absolutely must be free for all to acquire. However, there are plenty of things besides the finished projects that get made, so early drafts, progress reports, and other such bonus content will be made available on [this Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/whisperedforgework) If you appreciate the advisories, want to see more work like it, or just want to help me pay the bills, please consider making use of the patreon..
