I've had a handful of people say that there's no such thing as hostile spirits, or that you can simply disbelieve in them.

Even if you ascribe to a point of view that there's no truly malicious things in life - I wonder what sort of life you've lead, so far, but I will say there are simply things that care for you less than you care for a saltine cracker.

As for the idea of simply disbelieving in them, this can help in very niche situations, especially around illusionists, but otherwise is roughly as effective as disbelieving in a rock being thrown at you. It may sometimes miss, but otherwise the damage is there, ignored or not.
